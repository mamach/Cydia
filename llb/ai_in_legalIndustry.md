AI technology can accelerate document review and analysis, which is often time-consuming for legal professionals. AI-powered tools can scan and analyse documents, extract relevant information, identify patterns, and categorise documents based on their content. This helps lawyers quickly locate specific information and gain insights, enabling them to make informed decisions and provide more efficient and accurate legal advice.

Though AI has its uses, it is important to remember that human judgment, skill, and ethical considerations are still very important. Thus, rather than taking the place of human attorneys, AI should be viewed as an addition to the legal field, improving skills.
