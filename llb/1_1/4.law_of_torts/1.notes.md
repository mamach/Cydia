# Essential Elements of a Tort

Three essential elements which constitute a tort are
1. A wrongful act or Omission and
2. Duty imposed by the law.
3. The act must give rise to legal or actual damage and it should be of such a nature that it should give rise to a legal remedy in the form of an action for damages.


# Act or Omission
In order to make a person liable for a tort, he must have done some act which was not expected to do (or) he must have omitted to do something which he was supposed to do.


# Example

```
'A' erects a wall on his land which obstructs the light to 'B's house. Although it is undoubtedly a lawful act to erect a building on one's own land.
But since the neighbour has enjoyed uninterrupted light for years, he has argued the legal right to have this enjoyment.
So erection of construction by A on his own land is an invasion of the right of 'B' hence, not only damage but it is also unlawful and injurious.
```



# Moral Duty
Moral or Religious duty can't be considered under this lead, but it must be a duty primarily faced by the law.

e.g., 
```
A, a lady who falls ill and requests her neighbour B to look after her since she is all alone. B takes care of 'A' and extends all types of help like giving food and medicines to her and making her comfortable with his presence at the time of need. A recovered after sometime. Once B fell ill, he requested A to help him during his illness but A never acceded to B's request and B due to lack of proper care and help became disabled. Here, it was A's moral duty to look after B during his illness and this duty cannot be held as legal duty. Since, this moral duty has not been fixed by law itself, B cannot take any legal action against the lady 'A'.
```

# Religious duty
**Case Law:** In the case Dhadphale v. Gurav, (1881) 6 Bom 122
```
 Dhadphale was a servant in the temple and had a right to get the food offered to the idol and Gurav was under obligation to offer the food to idol but he failed to do so and the servant Dhadphale brought a suit against Gurav for damages. It was held by the Court that Gurav was not under legal obligation to give the food to the servant of the temple, failure to offer the food to idol was a breach of religious duty and not the legal duty hence, the plaintiff was not entitled for damages.
```
