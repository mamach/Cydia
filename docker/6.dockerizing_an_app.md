# Dockerizing an app
* Modifing an app to run inside docker container.
* 

* Configuration is done via environment variables.
* proper logging of application.

* Avoid reinventing the wheels.


* use alpine, or debian as base using FROM statement.
* after specifying base image you can add customizations.
* forking the original is not preferred.
* careful with base images as anyone can push changes to docker hub.


# example
* application
* dependencies like mongodb
