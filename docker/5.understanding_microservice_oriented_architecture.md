# Microservice Oriented Architecture

* small independent process that commmunicate through rest api.
* views are build using json responses.
* android/ios also build the views from json.
* 

# Depth
* monolithic are prone to single point of failure.
* horizontal scaling is simple
* one service can be in java other in rails etc.
* microservices will have associated overhead, like apis are talking to each other.

# Difficulties
* deployments are more complex
* hard to define upfront
* monolith first
* docker will simplify some of difficulties. 


e.g.,
* shipping
* store front
* inventory
* billing 


# API Gateway Pattern

* Composed of multiple services, users should still be interface as if it is a single application.
* API gateway will sit in front of all the backend microservices and makes proper calls to each microservice. Its job sounds like that of load balancer.
* Frontend service will sit on other side of API gateway and use the API to the other services.



# Docker and Microservices
* Managing is extra complex.
