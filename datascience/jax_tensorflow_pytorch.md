- Tensorflow and PyTorch keep track of gradients over neutral network parameters during training with both comprising high level API's for implementing the commonly used neural network functionality.

- PyTorch and Tensorflow are deep learning libraries consisting of high level apis for modern methods in deep learning.

- JAX is a more functionality minded library for arbitrary differentialble programming.

# JAX

- Jax is a python library designed for high performance numerical computing
- JAX is numpy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU with great automatic differentiation for high performance machine learning research.
- Along with deeplearning framework JAX has created a super polished linear algebra library with automatic differentiation and XLA report.

- JAX is a new machine learning library from google designed for high performance numerical computing.
- The Autograd library has the ability to differentiate through every native python and Numpy code.

- JAX can be used to differentiate, vectorize, JIT to GPU/TPU etc.


# Deeplearning

- DeepLearning owes a lot of its success to automatic differentiation.
