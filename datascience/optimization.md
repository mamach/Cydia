# Optimization

- In ML optimization of the results produced by models plays an important role in obtaining better results.

- Visualizing results in a good manner is very helpful in model optimization.

- PyCaret Library can be used to visualize the results from different modelling procedures.

- 

## What is PyCaret?

- PyCaret is opensource library that helps us in performing a variety of machine learning modelling automatically.

-  Low code interface.

- PyCaret combines visualization from various visualization  libs like yellowbricks, autovig, plotly, etc.




## Visualizing classification model

- AUC Score and Accuracy of model.
- ROC curve
- Confusion Matrix
- Decision boudary




## Visulizing regression model

## Visualizing clustering model

## Visualizing anomoly model
