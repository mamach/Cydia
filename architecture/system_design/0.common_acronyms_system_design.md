 4. KISS

## CAP
CAP theorem states that any distributed data store can only provide two the following three guarantees.
 1. Consistency - Every read receive most recent write or an error.
 2. Availability - Every request receives a response.
 3. Partition Tolerance - The system continues to operate in network faults.

More info can be found at "Please stop calling databases CP or AP" by Martin Kleppmann.

## BASE
- The ACID (Atomicity-Consistency-Isolation-Durability) model used in relational databases.
- ACID is too strict for NoSQL databases.
- BASE principle offers more flexibility, choosing availability over consistency.


## SOLID
SOLID principle is popular in OOP. There are 5 components.
1. SRP - Single Responsibility Principle. Each unit of code should have one responsibility.
2. OCP - Open Close Principle. Units of code should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle. A subclass should be able to be sustituted by its base class.
4. ISP - Interface Segmentation Principle. Expose multiple interfaces with specific responsibilities.
5. DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle. Use abstractions  to decouple dependencies in the system.

## KISS
Keep It Simple, Stupid is a design principle first noted by US Navy. It states that most systems work best if they are kept simple.
