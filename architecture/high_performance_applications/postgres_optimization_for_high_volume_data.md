- Use righ datatypes. e.g., datatype like smallint instead of integer can save space and improve performance.

- Use Indexes: indexes can significantly improve the performance of queries by allowing PostgreSQL to quickly find the rows that match a certain condition.

- Using indexes can add overhead to writes as each index must be updated every time a row is inserted, updated or deleted.

- Partitioning - If large table is growing quickly, it is suggested to use partitioning to break it up into smaller and more manageable pieces. This can improve the performance of queries.

- Use prepared statements - Prepared statements allows to compile a query once and then execute it multiple times with different paramter values.

- Use right hardware - Make sure enough CPU, memory, and storage is there to support database.

- Monitor and optimize - Use tools like explain to understand how PostgreSQL is executing queries and identify any bottlenecks. 
- Regularly monitor database and make adjustments as needed to ensure that it can handle high volume of data
