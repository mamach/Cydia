# Resources
## Books
* [Python Data Science Handbook(by Jake VanderPlas)](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) - An introduction to the major scientific Python/“PyData” packages and best practices.
* [Python for data science by wes mckinney(author of pandas) ](http://wesmckinney.com/pages/book.html): The author of pandas himself starts from basics and goes to advance features of pandas. In short great material to start learning pandas.
* [Scipy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/): One document to learn numerics, science, and data with Python. Tutorials on the scientific Python ecosystem: a quick introduction to central tools and techniques. The different chapters each correspond to a 1 to 2 hours course with increasing level of expertise, from beginner to expert. (Online, HTML, PDF) with Source code (github)
* [Python OOP's tutorial by Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc) : OOP concepts in python, which are extensively used in pytorch.
* [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) - A curated list of (long) blog posts on various aspects of Python programming from language fundamentals to advanced concepts, with applications along the way.

* Learn Python the Hard Way : widely used book for learning Python as a first programming language
* Automate the boring stuff with Python by Al Sweigart : Contains a lot of scripts to make your boring task easier.
* [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008)
* [Python Tricks](https://www.amazon.in/Python-Tricks-Buffet-Awesome-Features/dp/1775093301)
* [Learn x in y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/) : quick overview of main Python 3 features entirely using code examples
* [David Beazley’s courses, tutorials, and books](https://www.dabeaz.com/): generators, yields, descriptors, and other advanced topics

## Notebooks
* [Stanford numpy tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) : great little intro to key python libs and concepts for numeric programming
* [Peter Norvig’s Pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes): a github repo that contains well-made jupyter notebooks, ranging in topics from Gesture Typing 92 to A Concrete Introduction to Probability (using Python) 274. These notebooks make for some great reads and the coding style is a good resource to learn from, especially in ways of breaking down problems in clear, readable code.
* [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) Nice only book that covers all the essential Python basics without overwhelming the Python novice.
