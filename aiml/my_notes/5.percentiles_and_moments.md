# Percentiles
- Percentiles are measures that divide dataset into 100 equal parts. 
- The $p_{th}$ percentile is the value below which $p%$ of data falls.
- **Outlier Detection** percentile help identifying outliers. 
  - For example data points below $5^{th}$ percentile or above $95^{th}$ percentile can be considered outliers.
- **Feature Scaling** Percentile based scaling (e.g., Min-Max scaling using percentiles) is used to normalize features.
- **Model Evaluation** percentiles can be used in model evaluation to understand the distribution of prediction errors.

# Moments
- Moments are quantative measures related to the shape of of the dataset's distribution(PDF).
- **Feature Engineering** Moments can be used as features to describe data distributions.
- **Distribution Analysis** Understanding the distribution of features can help selecting appropriate models and algorithms.
- **Anomoly Detection** Higher moments(Skewness, Kurtosis) can help in detecting anomolies by indicating deviations from normal distribution.
- Mathematically

$$
\mu_n = \int_\infty^\infty (x-c)^n f(x) dx  \quad \text{for moment } n \text{ and around value } c
$$

- First Moment is **Mean** $\mu = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$
- Second Moment is **Variance** $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2$ 
- Third Moment is **Skewness** $Skewness = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\frac{x_i-\mu}{\sigma})^3$
- Fourth Moment is **Kurtosis** $Kurtosis = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\frac{x_i-\mu}{\sigma})^4 -3$

# Quartiles
- Quartiles divide dataset into four equal parts. 
- The first quartile $Q_1$ is the $25^{th}$ percentile.
- The second quartile $Q_2$ is the $50{th}$ percentile.
- The third quartile $Q_3$ is the $75{th}$ percentile.
- Used in **Data Summerization** quartiles provide a summary  of the data distribution and help in understanding the spread and central tendency.
- **Boxplot Analysis** Quartiles are used in box plots to visualize the distribution of data and identify outliers.
- **Feature Scaling** Quartiles can be used in robust scaling methods that are less sensitive to outliers compared to min-max scaling.
