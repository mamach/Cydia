# Conditional Probability
- Conditional probability measures the probability of an event occuring given that another event has already occured.
- It is fundamental in Bayesian inference, classification, and decision making processes.
- Mathematically 
$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$
- where $P(A|B)$ is the probability of $A \text{ given } B$.
- $P(A \cap B)$ is the joint probability of $A { and } B$ and
- $P(B)$ is probability of $B$

# Use Cases
## Bayesian Networks
- **Application** Used to model the probabilistic relationships among a set of variables.
- **Example**  Diagnosing diseases based on symptoms. Each symptom presence can conditionally depend on the presence of disease.

## Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Application** A classification algorithm based on Bayes theorem with the assumption of independence  between features.
- **Example** Spam email detection. The probability that an email is spam given the presence of certain words.

## Hidden Markov Models
- **Application** used for time series analysis, where the system is modeled as a Markov process with hidden states.
- **Example** Speech recognition. The probability of a sequence of spoken words given the acoustic signals.

## Decision Trees
- **Application** Used for making the decisions based on the conditions provided by different features.
- **Example** Predicting customer churn. The probability of a customer leaving given their usage pattern and other attributes.
