# Variance or Population Variance
- Average of the squared differences from the mean is called **variance**.

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{\Sigma ( X - \mu )^2 }{N}
$$


# Standard Deviation
- Square root of variance is called **standard deviation** $(\sigma)$.
- Used to identify outliers in the distribution.


# Sample Variance
- Used to calcualate variance when sample of data is considered.
- the squared difference from mean divided by N-1 is **sample variance**

$$
s^2 = \frac{\Sigma ( X - \mu )^2 }{N-1}
$$
