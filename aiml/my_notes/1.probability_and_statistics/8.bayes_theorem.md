# Bayes Theorem
- Bayes theorem is a fundamental theorem in probability theory and statistics, **providing a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on a new evidence**. The theorem is expressed as 

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A). P(A)}{P(B)}
$$


- where $P(A|B)$ is the posterior probability of event $A \text{ given event } B$
- $P(B|A)$ is the likelihood of event $B \text{ given event } A$
- $P(A)$ is the prior probability of event $A$
- $P(B)$ is the marginal probability of event $B$

# Use Cases

## Spam Filtering
- **Application** Determining wheter an email is spam.
- **Example** Let $A$ be the event that an email is spam, and $B$ be the event that certain words appear in the email. Bayes' Theorem helps compute the probability that an email is spam given the presence of certain words.

## Medical Diagnosis
- **Application** Estimating the likelihood of a disease.
- **Example** Let $A$ be the event that a patient has a disease, and $B$ be the event of positive test results. Bayes theorem is used to update the probability of having the disease based on test result.

## Machine Learning Classification
- **Application** Used in Naive Bayes Classifiers.
- **Example** classifying text documents into categories. Let $A$ be the event of a document belonging to a category, and $B$ be the presence of specific words. The classifier uses Bayes Theorem to predict the category of new documents.


# e.g., 

Suppose we want to determine the probability of a disease given a positive test result. Assume:

- $P(D) = 0.01$ (prior probability of disease)
- $P(T|D) = 0.99 $ (probability of a positive test given the disease)
- $P(T| \neg D) = 0.05$ (probability of a positive test given no disease) 
- $P(\neg D) = 0.99$  (prior probability of no disease)

First Compute $P(T)$
$$
P(T) = P(T|D). P(D) + P(T|\neg D). P(\neg D)
$$

$P(T) = (0.99×0.01)+(0.05×0.99)=0.0594$

Then, compute $P(D∣T):$

$$
P(D|T) = \frac{P(T|D). P(D)}{P(T)} = \frac{0.99 X 0.01}{0.0594} \approx .1667%
$$

So, the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is approximately 16.67%.
