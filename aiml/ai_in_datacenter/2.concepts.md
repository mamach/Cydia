# Intro to AI
- Uses statistic techniques to learn a model from observed data.
- feature extractors
- large amounts of data
- DNN (Deep Neural Networks)
- Inspired by child learning.
- 



## AI workflow
- Data Preperation -> Model Training -> Visualization -> Predictions

### Model Training
- A model is not ready to deploy with one iteration of training
- Training / Iterating is time consuming where GPU are used.
- Visualization


# ML and DL
## Classification Task
- dogs vs cats
- training with images of dogs and cats.
- DNN model(deep means multiple layers)
- input nodes, output nodes, hidden layers
- nodes referred as neurons.
- DNN will have many hidden layers.
- Models for speech recognition is different from image recognition.
- Object recognition, image classification, image segmentation, etc
- e.g., CNN is AlexNet Architecture
- 

## DL
- General Algorithms

## ML
- Custom Algorithms

## Confidence Vector
- for racoons, need to retrain the model with racoon images.
- true positive, true negative
- false positive, false negative

## Trained Model Optimizations
- Fusing Layers
- Pruning nodes that are not contributing significantly.


# Training and Inference

# ML vs. DL Summary

# AI Use-Cases
- Computer vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Reinforcement Learning
- Anomaly Detection
