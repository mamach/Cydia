# Retraining
* Once a model is trained and you get new data which can be used for training, you can load the previous model and train onto it. For example, you can save your model as a .pickle file and load it and train further onto it when new data is available. Do note that for the model to predict correctly, the new training data should have a similar distribution as the past data.
* Predictions tend to degrade based on the dataset you are using. For example, if you are trying to train using twitter data and you have collected data regarding a product which is widely tweeted that day. But if you use use tweets after some days when that product is not even discussed, it might be biased. The frequency will be dependent on dataset and there is no specific time to state as such. If you observe that your new incoming data is deviating vastly, then it is a good practise to retrain the model.
* Optimizing parameters on the aggregated data is not overfitting. Large data doesn't imply overfitting. Use cross validation to check for over-fitting.
