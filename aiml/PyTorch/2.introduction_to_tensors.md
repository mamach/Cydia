# Intro
- Tensors are the fundamental building block of machine learning.
- Tensors job is  to represent data in a numberical way.
- e.g., To represent an image as tensor shape is [3, 224,224], which means [channels, height, width].

- In tensor-speak(the language to describe tensors), the tensor have three dimensions.
- PyTorch love tensors, class for tensors is available at library **torch.Tensor**

## Scalar
- Scalar is a single number and in tensor-speak it is **zero dimension tensor**
```
scalar = torch.tensor(7)
scalar #outputs tensor(7)
```
- scalar is a single number, it is of type torch.Tensor
- to check the dimensions of a tensor using the **ndim** attribute
```
scalar.ndim #outputs 0
```

- to retrieve number from tensor
```
scalar.item() # outputs 7
```

## Vector
- Vector is a single dimension tensor but can contain many numbers.
```
vector = torch.tensor([7,8])
print(vector.ndim) # 1
vector.shape #tells how elements inside tensor are arranged.
```
