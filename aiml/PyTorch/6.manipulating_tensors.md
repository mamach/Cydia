- In deeplearning data gets represented as tensors.
- Data includes 
	- text
	- images
	- video
	- audio
	- protein structures etc
- Model learns by investingating those tensors and performs series of operations.
- Model trains to represent patterns in the input data.
- Operations on tensors dance between
	- Addition
	- Substraction
	- Multiplication
	- Division
	- Matrix Multiplication
