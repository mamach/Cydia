# Fundamentals
- OpenSource Machine Learning and DeepLearning framework.
- 

# Used for?
- PyTorch allows to manipulate and process data and write machine learning algorithms using Python code.

# Who uses?
- Meta, Tesla, Microsoft OpenAI etc.

# Why PyTorch?
- ML researchers love using PyTorch.
- Most used deep learning framework on Publications.
- Takes care of GPU accelaration(Makes code run faster)
- 

# Topics
- Intro to Tensors (Tensors aare the basic building block of all of ML and DL)
- Creating Tensors (Tensors can represent almost any kind of data(images, words, tables of numbers))
- Getting information from Tensors (Updating information in tensor)
- Manipulating Tensors (ML Algorithms like neural networks) involve manipulating tensors like adding, multiplying, combining etc.
- Dealing with Tensor Shapes (One of the common issues in ML is dealing with shape mismatches)
- Indexing Tensors (similart indexing in numpy array, python list etc., except the dimensions)
- Mixing PyTorch Tensors (PyTorch plays with tensors, Numpy likes Arrays and combination of both)
- Reproducibility (randomness not to be so random, seeding)
- Running tensors on GPU (Grphic Processing Units make code run faster, PyTorch makes it run code on GPUs).
