# Imputing Missing Data - Mean Replacement
in case huge outlier data - Median Replacement is good choice than Mean, as Median is less sensitive to outliers
Dropping data is not good idea
KNN - K nearest neighbours can also works sometimes
Deep Learning - suits for categorical data
Regression - MICE(Multiple Imputation by Chained Equation)
