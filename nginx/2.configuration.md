  return 200 "hello from regex match"
}
```
* preferential prefix match
```
location ^~ /Greet2{
  return 200 'hello from preferential prefix match'
}
```

## Varialbles
* There are two types of variables
	* Configuration variables($var1, $var2 etc)
	* Nginx Module Variables($http, $uri etc.)


```
events{}
http {
  include mime.types;
  server{
    listen 80;
    server_name <ip>;
    root /sites/demo;
    location /inspect{
      return 200 "$host \n $uri \n $args";
    }
  }
}
```

* set varaible with keyword set.
```
set $weekend 'No';
```

## Conditional statements
```
if($arg_apikey !1234){
  return 401 "Incorrect api key";
}
```

## Rewrites and Redirects

* default number of worker process are 1 or proportional to number of cores.
* following commands will give the cpu cores information
```
nproc
lscpu
ulimit -n // for worker connections
```

* Concurrancy = Worker_processes X Worker_connections


## Buffers and Timeouts
